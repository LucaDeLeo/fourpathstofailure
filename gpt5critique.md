This is strong work—clear thesis, crisp “four paths,” and an admirably operational posture (predictions, confidence levels, concrete countermeasures). It already reads like a LessWrong post: you front‑load an epistemic status, give falsifiable predictions, and keep the argument grounded in mechanisms rather than vibes.

Below are **high‑impact edits** I’d make before publishing, split into (A) accuracy/claims that want tightening, (B) math/feasibility checks, and (C) structure/style tweaks for LessWrong. I’ve also flagged a few **citation upgrades** where a primary or more recent source will increase trust.

---

## A) Claims to tighten (with source notes)

1. **EU AI Act & compute thresholds.**
   You’re right that *GPAI models with systemic risk* are presumed at **10²⁵ FLOPs** and that guidance kicked in this summer. Consider stating it exactly once and citing the Commission Q\&A (Jul 31, 2024) plus the July 2025 guidelines that specify a **two‑week notification when foreseeing or reaching 10²⁵ FLOPs**. This will prevent nitpicks and anchors the “compute threshold” frame in current law.

2. **“U.S. pushing deregulation.”**
   Accurate. The **America’s AI Action Plan** (Jul 2025) explicitly frames heavy regulation as counterproductive, rescinds EO 14110, and emphasizes streamlined permitting and “build, baby, build.” Quote sparingly and cite the White House PDF; legal memos summarizing the plan help, too.

3. **NVIDIA H100 attestation / CC‑Off by default.**
   Your point is directionally right: H100s support attestation & confidential computing, but **CC mode isn’t enabled by default in common deployments** (e.g., NVIDIA’s GPU Operator defaults to `off`). I’d phrase it as “CC features exist but are off unless explicitly enabled,” and cite NVIDIA docs/blog.

4. **Distributed swarms (DiLoCoX).**
   This is the most controversially “new” piece. The **0G/China Mobile** claim (357× communication efficiency; 107B model trained over 1 Gbps links) appears in a **startup write‑up/press context, not peer‑reviewed**. Keep it, but label it *tentative* and triangulate with older, peer‑reviewed comms‑reduction results like **Deep Gradient Compression (270–600×)** to show the mechanism is consistent with prior art.

5. **Folding\@home scale as precedent.**
   Good example. Anchor it with (a) Folding\@home’s own “2020 in review” post noting exascale, and (b) a mainstream contemporaneous report that pegs **1.5–2.4 exaFLOPS**. If you keep the “280,000 GPUs” figure, add a source or soften to “hundreds of thousands of volunteers.”

6. **China–Pakistan proliferation is ongoing.**
   Good to cite **2025 State Department sanctions** and, for continuity, a **CRS brief** summarizing the continuing “systemic risk” framing and EU/US divergence. This buttresses your “proxy/deniability” pathway.

7. **Biopreparat scale and concealment.**
   The numbers you use (≈**65,000 employees**, decades‑long concealment) are supported by congressional testimony and scholarly histories. Link Ken Alibek’s 2001 testimony and a modern academic history for credibility.

8. **Dimona deception as inspection‑evasion precedent.**
   Cite the **National Security Archive** synthesis and a mainstream account mentioning **elaborate ruses** during the 1960s inspections; it strengthens the “physical deception is tractable; software is easier” line.

9. **Diplomatic pouches for weights transfer.**
   The **Vienna Convention** makes the diplomatic bag **not openable or detainable** (Art. 27(3)), but note it must contain **official items**—so this is a legal shield *if abused*, not a carte blanche. A one‑line caveat avoids overclaiming.

10. **SEC whistleblower payouts.**
    “\$2.2B” is right (FY2024 annual report). Great precedent for bounty‑style incentives—add the SEC report link.

11. **“IAEA admits safeguards are ex post facto warning systems.”**
    This exact quote is often paraphrased. If you can’t find the verbatim line in an IAEA primary, rephrase to: “safeguards aim to **detect and deter** diversion rather than physically prevent it” and cite an authoritative explainer. (If you prefer to keep the quote, add the precise source.)

## B) Numbers & feasibility (tighten one section)

Your “GPU swarms can reach 10²⁵ FLOPs in **35–60 days** for **\$30–60M**” is the claim most likely to be nitpicked. Two quick fixes:

**1) Show your units and a sensitivity band.**
With **50,000 GPUs × 40 TFLOP/s** (usable), you get:

* Aggregate: $50{,}000 \times 40 \times 10^{12} = 2\times10^{18}$ FLOP/s.
* Time to 10²⁵ FLOPs (no overhead): $10^{25} / (2\times10^{18}) \approx 5\times10^{6}$ s ≈ **57.9 days**.
* With the **18.9–40% slowdown** you cite, that stretches to **\~72–97 days**.
  So *with 40 TFLOP/s “usable”*, the lower end **35 days** is hard to justify.

If instead you argue “usable tensor compute” of **\~100 TFLOP/s per GPU** (e.g., partial BF16 utilization on gaming cards), the math becomes:

* $50{,}000 \times 100 \times 10^{12} = 5\times10^{18}$ FLOP/s → **23.1 days** raw;
* Adjusted by 1.24–1.67× overhead → **29–39 days**.

**Actionable edit:**
Present a **scenario table** (Conservative / Mid / Aggressive) varying (i) per‑GPU effective FLOPs, (ii) overhead, and (iii) GPU count, and show time & cost bands. This disarms critiques without changing your conclusion that distributed training is *strategically feasible*.

**2) Cost sanity check.**
\$30–60M is plausible for **short‑term rental or mixed illicit sourcing**, but readers will ask for a back‑of‑the‑envelope: e.g., *N* GPUs × *\$r/day* × *T* days + *or* capex at **\$1.5–2.5k** per used 4090 (grey market) + logistics. A one‑paragraph **cost decomposition** (with wide error bars) will help.

**3) Word choice on DiLoCoX.**
“357× speedup” appears to be a **communication‑efficiency figure**, not an end‑to‑end training time speedup. Say “**357× communication reduction** enabling near‑commodity uplinks,” to stay precise while keeping the punch. Then link Deep Gradient Compression as historical precedent for the mechanism.

---

## C) Structure & style tweaks (LessWrong‑targeted)

* **Lead with a cleaner TL;DR.**
  Put the 4 circumvention paths in one sentence (with a 5–9 word gloss each) and **one sentence** on why countermeasures won’t fully close them. This helps skimmers.

* **Add a “What would change our mind” box.**
  You already give predictions; also state **disconfirmers**, e.g.:
  *If: ≥70% of DC GPUs in US/EU run CC‑On with verifiable attestation + IXPs adopt standardized training‑pattern detection + robust secondary sanctions with high compliance* → *then: Pathway 2 becomes substantially harder; detection within 24h becomes (credence) 65% instead of 40%.*
  (Calibrate numbers to your taste.)

* **Cite once, then reuse.**
  For recurring facts (10²⁵ FLOPs, CC modes), cite the first instance; later references can say “(see earlier).”

* **Tighten the “AI Innovation Zones” section.**
  Add one line linking **governor/industry pushback** against state‑level AI rules and the federal plan’s **penalizing “burdensome” state rules**, to show the **jurisdiction‑shopping pressure** is live today.

* **Inspection realism.**
  Your Dimona and Biopreparat sections are convincing. Consider a short **table of covers** (“climate modeling,” “molecular dynamics,” “quant finance”) vs **overlapping telemetry** you’d lean on (IXP bursts, grid anomalies, GPU attestation gaps). This keeps the post concrete without adding how‑to detail.

* **Ethical hazard note.**
  Add two sentences making clear this is **governance red‑teaming** to *improve* defenses, not to aid wrongdoing. (LW readers appreciate the explicitness.)

---

## Quick citation upgrades you can drop in

* **EU compute threshold (10²⁵) & notifications.** Commission Q\&A (Jul 31, 2024) and 2025 guidance and summaries.
* **U.S. deregulatory stance** (rescission + streamlining) in **America’s AI Action Plan** (Jul 2025).
* **H100 confidential computing modes & defaults.** NVIDIA blog + Operator docs (default `off`).
* **DiLoCoX claims** (label as vendor‑reported) and **Deep Gradient Compression** for mechanism.
* **Folding\@home exascale** milestone.
* **Ongoing China–Pakistan sanctions (2025)** to support the “proxy” pattern.
* **Biopreparat scale** and **testimony**.
* **Dimona deception**.
* **Vienna Convention—diplomatic bag** (inviolable; official items only).
* **SEC whistleblower: \$2.2B total** (FY2024 report).

## Small line‑edits you can apply fast

* **Define FLOP once** (you do) and *avoid* equating 10²⁵ exactly with GPT‑4; say “**roughly GPT‑4‑scale training** (and now an EU systemic‑risk threshold).”
* **“357× speedup” → “357× comms reduction enabling 1 Gbps links.”**
* **“Ship globally in CC‑Off mode by default” → “CC features exist but are **off by default** in common fleet deployments unless enabled by operator policy.”**
* **Add a one‑line caveat** after the diplomatic‑pouch sentence: “Abuse would violate Article 27(4), but practical inspection barriers remain.”
* **Change the IAEA sentence** to “Safeguards are designed primarily to **detect and deter** diversion; they often function as **ex post** warning systems rather than absolute prevention.” (Or add the exact quote if you find the primary.)

---

## Optional additions that would level this up

* **Scenario chart (even text‑only):**
  *Swarm scale vs. days to 10²⁵ FLOPs* across Effective TFLOPs/GPU ∈ {40, 60, 100}, Overhead ∈ {20%, 40%}, GPU count ∈ {25k, 50k, 100k}. It makes the feasibility legible and inoculates you against single‑point estimates.

* **Defender “kill‑chain” diagram.**
  Put “Passport attestation → IXP burst detector → Grid telemetry correlator → Inspection triage → Sanctions/Bond forfeiture” in a 5‑step flow. Your “fusion watchfloor” comes alive.

* **Threats to validity.**
  A short section listing assumptions that, if wrong (e.g., IXPs don’t adopt standard detectors; clouds don’t keep logs; algorithmic efficiency collapses the 10²⁵ threshold), would weaken parts of the case.

## Verdict

You’ve written a timely, concrete red‑team against the “perfect moratorium” premise that **integrates history with 2024–2025 realities**. With the handful of tightening edits above—especially around **distributed training math**, **DiLoCoX framing**, and **a few precise citations**—this will land well with the LessWrong audience and withstand adversarial reading.

If you want, I can produce a **tracked‑changes pass** that implements these edits directly (including the scenario table and compact source footnotes).
