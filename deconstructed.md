# Deconstructed Claims

## Core Claims

• Four mechanisms allow circumvention of an ASI moratorium: regulatory havens, distributed GPU swarms, hidden state supercomputers, proxy datacenters
• This analysis applies to international AI governance proposals targeting frontier capabilities training
• The proposed moratorium seeks to prevent ASI development for twenty years
• ASI means AI systems that outperform humans across virtually every cognitive task
• The moratorium only covers detectable datacenters in signatory nations

## Moratorium Mechanism Claims

• The moratorium prohibits ASI development and capabilities that could lead to ASI
• Specific dangerous capabilities are banned (AI self-improvement, self-replication, expert persuasion, expert knowledge of chemical/biological weapons)
• Developers must demonstrate models won't enable dangerous capabilities before training
• Training License required for runs above 10^25 FLOPS
• Compute License required for cloud providers above 10^17 FLOPS
• Application License required to deploy new use-cases
• Authorities monitor electricity grid usage to detect non-licensed compute centers
• 12-day detection windows are created

## Regulatory Flight Claims

• AI models can be trained in one jurisdiction and transmitted instantly to another
• A.Q. Khan ran a nuclear proliferation network for 30 years despite export controls
• Khan operated from Pakistan, used shell companies in Dubai and Malaysia
• Companies could relocate to non-signatory jurisdictions
• FTX moved to Bahamas in 3 months to avoid SEC oversight
• Small nations might offer AI Innovation Zones with tax holidays and exemptions
• Shell companies can acquire GPUs through multiple jurisdictions
• Trained models can sit behind API endpoints on global CDNs
• Stem cell research concentrated in areas with favorable regulation after US funding cuts
• Phil Zimmermann published PGP source code as a book to bypass export controls
• Binance secretly taught US customers to bypass geographic restrictions

## Distributed GPU Swarms Claims

• Training runs can be fragmented across tens of thousands of consumer graphics cards
• Each card can operate below licensing thresholds
• Modern gaming computers rival yesterday's supercomputers
• Gradient compression algorithms reduce communication needs 100x
• Training can occur over home internet connections
• 50,000 participants across 60 countries could rival major facilities
• Folding@home reached 1.5×10^18 FLOPS, more than world's top 100 supercomputers combined
• Smominru botnet infected over 500,000 machines
• The botnet mined $8500 USD equivalent per day in January 2018
• BitTorrent had 150 million monthly active users in January 2012
• The engineering for distributed training is virtually solved

## Covert State Supercomputers Claims

• Soviet Union operated Biopreparat from 1974-1991
• 60,000 people across 52 facilities developed bioweapons while party to BWC
• Facilities masqueraded as pharmaceutical plants
• 1979 accident killed 100 people in Sverdlovsk
• Program stayed hidden until defector Vladimir Pasechnik exposed it
• Countries operate exascale supercomputers for climate modeling, nuclear simulations, cryptanalysis
• These facilities employ thousands and consume city-scale power
• No new infrastructure needed to repurpose existing supercomputers
• Job names can use existing terminology to hide AI work
• Staff already have security clearances
• What takes Google 6 months takes 2 weeks on weapons-simulation hardware
• Iraq built nuclear facilities under IAEA monitoring using "materials production" cover
• Israel's Dimona facility was labeled "textile plant" then "nuclear research centre"
• US inspectors were deceived by bricked-over elevators and hallways
• Inspectors can only inspect declared facilities

## Offshore Proxy Datacenters Claims

• China provided Pakistan weapons-grade uranium, warhead blueprints, missile technology in 1980s-90s
• Both nations invoked sovereignty when confronted
• Neither recognized third-party authority over bilateral relations
• Companies could offer $2 billion infrastructure loans to middle-income nations
• Facilities can be built as 40 modular units with 200 GPUs each
• Each unit below licensing thresholds
• Units can be disguised as 5G edge computing nodes
• Units can be distributed across military bases and universities
• Host nations can invoke sovereignty to block inspections
• Pakistan-China nuclear transfers tracked from 1977 but unstoppable until 1998 tests
• North Korea sold missiles to Iran, Syria, Libya despite Missile Technology Control Regime
• Huawei built facilities leaving government servers open to exfiltration
• Weights can transfer through diplomatic pouches (legally untouchable)
• Distributed facility can train frontier model within 7 months

## Cascading Effects Claims

• Once one path succeeds, others follow
• Haven states attract investment after early profits
• Distributed networks share techniques openly
• Classified programs cite suspected violations to justify expansion
• Proxy relationships proliferate as countries seek AI partners
• All four paths could activate simultaneously
• Traditional controls assume visible infrastructure, corporate compliance, state cooperation

## Proposed Solutions Claims

• Three-layer solution proposed
• Layer 1: High-end chips prove identity and operations via tamper-evident logs
• Missing or fake logs make illicit clusters easier to spot
• Layer 2: Update capability thresholds on a cadence
• Fuse multiple signals (attestation logs, network patterns, power/heat)
• Layer 3: Unannounced inspections
• Protected/bountied whistleblowing
• Risk-weighted performance bonds
• If-then commitments with 6-month recalibration cycles
• Chipmakers and clouds can pilot open attestation spec
• Pre-approved datacenter designs with built-in verification hooks
• Voluntary data from grids/IXPs/clouds to validate swarm signatures
• Model laws for whistleblower protections and performance bonds

## Meta Claims

• Success depends on anticipating failure modes
• Governance systems must assume partial compliance, fragmented enforcement, adaptive adversaries
• Technical verification must be built into compute hardware
• Oversight rules must update before becoming obsolete
• Regulations need human intelligence and economic incentives
• Twenty years might be enough to solve alignment and develop institutions
