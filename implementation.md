# Implementation Roadmap: Closing the Circumvention Gaps in AI Governance

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a concrete 24-month implementation pathway for the ten solutions proposed to strengthen AI moratorium frameworks. Rather than requiring simultaneous global adoption, we propose a phased approach leveraging market incentives, existing institutions, and strategic sequencing to build momentum toward comprehensive governance.

**Core principle**: Start with voluntary adoption by market leaders, leverage financial systems for enforcement, then formalize through international agreements.

## Phased Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Market-Led Adoption (Months 0-6)
**Focus**: Solutions 1, 6, 7 - Hardware security & insurance

#### Compute Passports (Solution 1)
- **Champions**: NVIDIA, AMD, Intel

### Phase 3: Financial Leverage (Months 12-18)
**Focus**: Solutions 3, 9 - Secondary sanctions & conditional aid

#### Secondary Sanctions (Solution 3)
- **Champions**: SWIFT, Bank for International Settlements
- **Minimum Viable Pilot**: Compliance required for banks financing >$100M AI infrastructure
- **Incentive alignment**: Banks avoid sanctions risk, creates pressure on haven states

- How to handle refused inspections? Automatic sanctions?

**Research Needed**:
- Lessons from IAEA, OPCW, BWC verification attempts
- Technical requirements for boot-level GPU verification
- Diplomatic framework for inspector immunity

## Critical Dependencies & Risk Factors

### Technical Dependencies

2. **Cryptographic standards** - Need NIST/ISO standards for compute attestation
3. **Network visibility** - Major IXPs and ISPs must participate

### Political Dependencies
1. **EU-US alignment** - Divergent approaches (EU precautionary vs US innovation) must reconcile
2. **China engagement** - Without China, 40% of global compute remains outside system
3. **Industry buy-in** - Google, Microsoft, Meta resistance could kill voluntary adoption

### Economic Dependencies
1. **Cost-benefit ratio** - Compliance costs must not exceed competitive advantage
2. **First-mover advantage** - Early adopters need market rewards

## Open Research Questions

### Technical Research Priorities
1. **Compute passport cryptography**: Design protocol resistant to both classical and quantum attacks while maintaining <0.1% overhead
2. **Distributed training detection**: Develop traffic analysis techniques that work despite encryption and compression
3. **HSM-compatible training**: Enable distributed training while maintaining cryptographic custody of weights
4. **Efficiency tracking**: Create objective metrics for algorithmic improvement to calibrate dynamic thresholds

### Policy Research Priorities
1. **Extraterritorial enforcement**: Legal pathways for technology-based sanctions under international trade law
2. **Regulatory capture prevention**: Governance structures that resist incumbent manipulation
3. **International coordination**: Minimal viable coalition for effective governance (G7? G20? UN?)
4. **Liability frameworks**: How to assign responsibility for AI harms across developer/deployer/user chain

### Economic Research Priorities
1. **Compliance cost modeling**: Full economic analysis of implementation costs across solutions
2. **Circumvention economics**: Cost curves for each evasion pathway under different enforcement regimes
3. **Innovation impact**: Effect of regulations on beneficial AI development speed
4. **Market structure**: Will regulations entrench incumbents or enable competition?

## Conclusion

This implementation roadmap transforms the ten proposed solutions from academic proposals into actionable policy. By sequencing adoption through market incentives, financial leverage, and international coordination, we can build momentum toward comprehensive governance while maintaining flexibility to adapt as we learn.

The key insight: perfect enforcement is neither necessary nor possible. We need only raise the cost and difficulty of circumvention sufficiently that legitimate pathways become more attractive than evasion. This buying time for technical AI safety research while building institutional capacity for long-term governance.

The window for implementation is narrowing as capabilities advance and competing national strategies diverge. Beginning with voluntary adoption by market leaders in the next 6 months could catalyze broader adoption within 24 months. The alternative - waiting for perfect international consensus - guarantees the circumvention pathways identified will be exploited.

Next step: Convene working groups for each solution with representation from industry, government, academia, and civil society to refine these proposals into detailed technical specifications and policy frameworks.
